RATIO — COGNITIVE & MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH

Ratio blends cognitive science, educational psychology, and AI into one system.

This document outlines the research principles that guide the design.

⸻

🧠 I. Cognitive Science Foundations

1. Spacing Effect (Ebbinghaus)

Learning is more effective when review sessions are spaced apart.
Ratio models retention curves dynamically per concept.

2. Active Recall

Memoria forces retrieval-based practice, which strengthens memory pathways.

3. Chunking Theory

Bibliotheca + Lectio break complex material into structured chunks.

4. Dual Coding Theory

Ratio’s UI uses:
	•	text
	•	structured diagrams
	•	animations

to reinforce retention.

📐 II. Machine Learning Principles

1. Semantic Embeddings

Using transformer-based models to encode concepts into a high-dimensional vector space.

Applications:
	•	similarity search
	•	concept clustering
	•	knowledge graph construction

2. Micro-Lesson Generation

LLMs break complex topics into:
	•	summaries
	•	analogies
	•	step-by-step explanations

3. Adaptive Spaced Repetition

The SR model considers:
	•	review difficulty
	•	previous failures
	•	predicted forgetting time
	•	concept strength

Planned models:
	•	SM-2
	•	Logistic knowledge tracing
	•	Bayesian decay modeling

🧬 III. Knowledge Architecture

Concept Graph

A graph where nodes = ideas, edges = conceptual relationships.

Uses:
	•	prerequisite detection
	•	learning path generation
	•	gap analysis

Embedding Retrieval

Stored in a vector database for:
	•	pace adjustment
	•	topic resurfacing
	•	semantic grouping
