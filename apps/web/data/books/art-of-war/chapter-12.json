  "summary": "Sun Tzu outlines five ways to use fire in warfare and explains the conditions in which each is appropriate. Timing, weather, wind, and the enemy’s supplies determine whether fire becomes a decisive weapon or a costly mistake.",
  "content": "<p>Sun Tzu said: There are five ways to use fire in attack: burning soldiers, burning stores, burning equipment, burning arsenals, and burning supply lines.</p><p>Fire attacks depend on proper conditions—dry weather, wind direction, and the opportunity to strike when the enemy is vulnerable.</p><p>When fire breaks out inside the enemy’s camp, respond immediately from the outside. When fire begins but the enemy remains calm, wait for the right moment.</p><p>Do not use fire without adequate preparation. Timing and coordination are essential.</p><p>A general who uses fire wisely gains victory. One who uses it recklessly destroys his own army.</p>",
