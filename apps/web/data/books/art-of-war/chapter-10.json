  "summary": "Sun Tzu defines six types of terrain and explains how each affects mobility, engagement, and risk. Understanding terrain determines whether armies should fight, retreat, advance, or avoid conflict.",
  "content": "<p>Sun Tzu said: There are six kinds of terrain—accessible, entangling, temporizing, narrow passes, precipitous heights, and positions at a great distance.</p><p>Each type requires different strategies. To ignore these is to invite defeat.</p><p>When the ground is accessible, occupy the sunny side and keep the high ground. When roads are narrow, block them. When heights are steep, hold them.</p><p>The commander who understands terrain wins. The one who does not is defeated.</p>",
