  "content": "<p>Sun Tzu said: In battle, use the direct method to engage and the indirect method to win.</p><p>There are only two methods of attack—direct and indirect—but their combinations are endless.</p><p>Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of the trigger.</p><p>When energy is properly channeled, even a small force becomes powerful. When misdirected, a large force is easily defeated.</p><p>Therefore, the expert in war sustains his army's spirit and measures the enemy's weaknesses before striking.</p>",
