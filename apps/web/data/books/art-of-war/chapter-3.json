  "summary": "Sun Tzu emphasizes that supreme excellence is winning without fighting. Destroying the enemy’s will, plans, and alliances is superior to destroying armies or cities. Strategy, intelligence, and timing outperform brute force. Know yourself and the enemy to avoid defeat.",
  "content": "<p>Sun Tzu said: In war, the best policy is to take a state intact. To ruin it is inferior. It is better to subdue the enemy without fighting than to win by destroying them.</p><p>The highest form of generalship is to thwart the enemy’s plans. The next best is to prevent alliances. After that, attack their armies; the worst is to besiege walled cities.</p><p>Sieges drain resources and morale and should only be attempted when no other option remains.</p><p>A skillful leader defeats the enemy without losing a single man. He captures everything intact, using strategy rather than force.</p><p>If you know the enemy and know yourself, you will not be defeated. If you know yourself but not the enemy, you will suffer losses. If you know neither, you will be destroyed.</p><p>Thus, the wise commander wins first by preparation and strategy, and only afterward seeks battle.</p>",
