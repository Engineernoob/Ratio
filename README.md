📚 RATIO — A PERSONAL INTELLIGENCE ENGINE

Designed & engineered by Taahirah Denmark

Ratio is a private, precision-built learning system designed to compress decades of knowledge into minutes — and then make that knowledge stick.

It blends:
• ⚡ TikTok-speed micro-lessons
• 📚 Blinkist/Headway-style synthesis
• 🧩 Brilliant-style interactive reasoning
• 🧱 A modern memory palace (Memoria)
• 🏛️ A monochrome virtual library with living bookshelves
• 🧬 AI-assisted knowledge extraction, modeling, and retention

All of this lives inside one daily ritual:

Learn → Understand → Retain

Your own internal intelligence architecture.

🏛 Core Domains of Ratio

Below is the conceptual layout of Ratio’s cognitive engine — the six pillars of learning, synthesis, and memory.

⸻

1. OIKOS — Home Feed (Cognitive Intake)

Your daily intelligence dashboard.

Includes:
• Lectio: book chapters, summaries, structured insights
• Ritual: micro-lessons, cognitive drills, curated wisdom
• Memoria: recall cards, active testing, spaced repetition
• Atmosphere: floating fog, dithering backgrounds, monochrome UI
• Adaptive flow: content shifts with your learning patterns

⸻

2. BIBLIOTHECA — The Library

A monochrome ancient-modern hybrid library.

Features:
• Animated 3D bookshelf grid
• Leather-bound book spines (monochrome aesthetic)
• Filters by discipline, era, difficulty, completion
• Tap → Reader Modal (Apple Books style)
• Chapters stored as JSON (/data/books/[title]/chapter-x.json)
• Planned EPUB → JSON ingestion pipeline

⸻

3. MEMORIA — The Memory Engine

Your internal memory palace.
• Concept flashcards
• Micro-tests (Q&A)
• Spaced repetition scheduler
• Daily “Review Deck”
• Retention %, streak, concept strength
• Backed by /data/memoria.json
• Future ML: knowledge decay modeling + embedding similarity

⸻

4. LABORATORIVM — Logic & Problem Solving

A cognitive gym.
• Logic puzzles
• Pattern drills
• Rhetoric exercises
• Mathematical reasoning
• Unlockable sets
• Stored in /data/puzzles/

⸻

5. ARS RATIONIS — Thinking Architecture

Metacognition and reasoning frameworks.
• First-principles reasoning
• Philosophical methodology
• Strategic decision models
• Cognitive behavior patterns
• Stoic + Aristotelian + Rational frameworks

⸻

6. SCHOLARIVM — Rituals & Progress

Your personal intelligence profile.
• Reading streak
• Memory mastery
• Pattern-recognition growth
• Daily rituals
• Cognitive performance metrics

🧠 The Research Side (What Makes Ratio Graduate-School-Ready)

Ratio isn’t just a UI project — it’s fundamentally a cognitive science + AI/ML research system.

Ratio focuses on:

🔬 Semantic knowledge embedding
Using transformer models to encode conceptual relationships.

🔬 Adaptive spaced repetition
A scheduler inspired by:
• SM-2 (Anki)
• Duolingo Birdbrain
• Bayesian knowledge tracing
• Forgetting-curve modeling

🔬 Cognitive load modulation
Adjusting difficulty based on performance signals.

🔬 Concept decomposition via LLMs
Breaking ideas into structured micro-lessons.

🔬 Retrieval-augmented microlearning
Embedding retrieval + auto-generated explanations.

This is the kind of work that impresses research committees.
