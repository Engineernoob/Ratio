OIKOS is an ancient study chamber within a digital scholarly OS.
The user is greeted by a cinematic neo-classical vista, leading into floating engraved stone tablets representing their daily scholarly triad: Lectio, Ritual, Memoria.
Below, the day’s feed unfurls as animated parchment scrolls with selectable micro-tests and rituals.
The entire experience is wrapped in fog, dithering, and subtle parallax to evoke ancient knowledge awakening within a modern interface.
